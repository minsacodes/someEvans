# Session 5: Tabular data: Multivariate data


_____


We collect multiple variables for a particular purpose, knowing that social complexity can hardly be directly explained with bivariate or univariate approaches. As it is difficult to visualize information with high dimensional data; you should consider summarising all these variable into a composite index (latent), as I showed in session 2.

However, if you have a good reason to keep the original data, let me show you some plots you may use.

_____


This time, I will use the [data about city safety](https://jpn.nec.com/en/global/ad/insite/download/economist/en/data_workbook_dl.html):

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(rio)

link="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/data/raw/master/safeCitiesIndexAll.xlsx"

safe=import(link)
```


These several variables are telling us information about the safety levels of some cities in the world, and are related to **D**_igital_, **H**_ealth_, **I**_nfrastructure_, and **P**_ersonal_ dimensions. For each of these dimensions, there are measures of actions taken (**In**), and results (**Out**). We have 49 variables.

Would making a plot of 49 variables  be a good idea?

Let's make  a heatmap. First, we need some reshaping, because the input data should be in long format:
* This is _wide_:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
head(safe)
```
*This is _long_:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(reshape2)

safeL=melt(safe, # all the data
           id.vars = 'city') # unique id per row
head(safeL)
```

Again, the _melting_ changed the direction of the data: the columns were sent into rows. This looks like panel data format or _long format_ (the original is the _wide format_). Now, the heatmap using this format:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
base = ggplot(data = safeL, aes(x = variable,
                                y =city)) 

heat1= base +  geom_tile(aes(fill = value)) 
heat1
```

Here you can see what rows have higher or lower colors on what set of variables. You can add color pallette:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
#inverse color -1
heat2 = heat1 + scale_fill_gradient(low = 'grey',
                                    high = "black")
heat2
```

The column and row names need some work:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
heat2 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, 
                                         hjust = 1,
                                         size = 4),
              axis.text.y = element_text(size = 4))
```


The last heatmap above could be 'ordered' so that column and row positions can give us more information:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# change in REORDER
base= ggplot(data = safeL, aes(x = reorder(variable, 
                                           value, median),
                               y =reorder(city,
                                          value, median)))
# THIS IS THE SAME
base + geom_tile(aes(fill = value)) + 
    scale_fill_gradient(low = 'grey90',high = "grey50") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1,size = 4),
              axis.text.y = element_text(size = 4))
```


This is still hard to read. An alternative could be to average each dimension. Let me show you this example:

a. Variables you need to average: columns with the text 'D_In_': 

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(magrittr)
#notice I do not need the 'city':
safe[,c(grep("D_In_", names(safe) ))]%>%head()
```

b. Compute and save the average **per row**:

```{r, eval=TRUE}


#averaging only numbers, as 'city' is not in data:
apply(safe[,c(grep("D_In_",names(safe) ))], #data
      1, #by row
      mean)%>% #function to apply by row to data
         round(2) # round the result

```

c. Create that column:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
safe$DIN=apply(safe[,c(grep("D_In_",names(safe) ))],1,mean)%>%round(2)
```

Now let's do the rest:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
safe$DOUT=apply(safe[,c(grep("D_Out_",names(safe) ))],1,mean)%>%round(2)

safe$HIN=apply(safe[,c(grep("H_In_",names(safe) ))],1,mean)%>%round(2)

safe$HOUT=apply(safe[,c(grep("H_Out_", names(safe) ))],1,mean)%>%round(2)

safe$IIN=apply(safe[,c(grep("I_In_", names(safe) ))],1,mean)%>%round(2)

safe$IOUT=apply(safe[,c(grep("I_Out_", names(safe) ))],1,mean)%>%round(2)

safe$PIN=apply(safe[,c(grep("P_In_", names(safe) ))],1,mean)%>%round(2)

safe$POUT=apply(safe[,c(grep("P_Out_", names(safe) ))],1,mean)%>%round(2)


```


Let's keep all the **Input** variables:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
safeINS=safe[,c(1,grep("IN$", colnames(safe)))] # '$' for 'end with'.
head(safeINS)

```
Let's rename the vars in this data set:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
names(safeINS)=c("city",'DIGITAL','HEALTH','INFRASTR','PERSONAL')
```

Remember we need to reshape:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
safeINS_long=melt(safeINS,id.vars = 'city')
```

Let's redo our heat map:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
base= ggplot(data = safeINS_long, 
             aes(x = reorder(variable,
                             value, 
                             median),
                 y =reorder(city,
                            value, 
                            median)))

base + geom_tile(aes(fill = value)) + 
       scale_fill_gradient(low = 'grey90',
                           high = "grey50") +
       theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,
                                        hjust = 1,
                                        size = 4),
             axis.text.y = element_text(size = 4))
```


When you have this limited amount of variables, you may try a radar plot:


```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=12, eval=TRUE}
base  = ggplot(safeINS_long, 
               aes(x = variable, 
                   y = value, 
                   group = city)) + #new
        geom_polygon(fill = 'gray',
                     col='orange') 

plot1 = base + coord_polar()

plot2 = plot1 + facet_wrap(~city,# one plot per city
                           ncol = 10) # ten plot per row
plot2
```

The radar plot describes how a cases is doing in every dimension (we have four dimensions). 

We could improve the plot by ordering the facet and increasing the font size of the name of dimensions (X), and having less columns:

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=12, eval=TRUE}

plot2 = plot1 + facet_wrap(~reorder(city,value, median, order=TRUE),ncol = 10)


plot3 = plot2 + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12)) 
plot3 
```

We can also highlight the case's names, let's change the _theme_ from above:

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=12, eval=TRUE}
plot4 = plot3 + theme(legend.position="none",
                strip.text = element_text(size = 20)) #here!!!
plot4 
```

You could add extra customization if wanted:

```{r, fig.width=15, fig.height=12, eval=TRUE}

### arguments
newBackGroundGrid=element_rect(fill = "white",
                         colour = "red",
                         size = 0.5,
                         linetype = "dashed")

newBackLineGrid=element_line(size = 1,
                      linetype = 'solid',
                      colour = "lightblue")

### more customization
plot4+ theme(panel.background = newBackGroundGrid,
             panel.grid.major = newBackLineGrid)
                        
```


The colors above **are not** the best choice, I just used them for you to notice where to make changes. Keep in mind that areas are difficult to compare, so the plots above might be used with care.

Finally, let me produce a plot using all the input variables, but reducing their dimensionality with a technique names multidimensional scaling.

You can use multidimensional scaling to represent all the variables in a two dimensional plot. This will create a **map** that will allow you to visualize neighbourhoods of cases. 

Let's see:

a. Get all the **input** columns:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
allIN=safe[,c(grep("_In_", names(safe) ))]
names(allIN)
```

b. Use the *id* as row names:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
rownames(allIN)=safe$city
```

c. Compute the distance among cases:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
dist_in_safe=dist(allIN)
```

d. Get map using multidimensional scaling:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
theMap=cmdscale(dist_in_safe,k = 2)%>%
  as.data.frame()
theMap
```

Let plot the countries:

```{r, eval=TRUE}

library(ggpubr)

points1= ggscatter(theMap, x = "V1", y = "V2", 
          size = 2,label = rownames(theMap)) 
points1

```

The default labelling is not good. Let's use *ggrepel* instead:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(ggrepel)

points1= ggscatter(theMap, x = "V1", y = "V2", 
          size = 2) + theme_void() # for NO dimensions
points1 + 
    geom_text_repel(aes(label=rownames(theMap)),
                    size=1.5) 

```
