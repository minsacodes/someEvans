# Session 1

In this session we will briefly review some basic principles. We will cover:

1. [Data](#Data).
2. [Elements](#Elements).
3. [Objects](#Objects).


## DATA

In general, it all starts with a data file. In my case, I have the data in this link:
```{r dataLink, eval=FALSE}
location="https://github.com/EvansDataScience/data/raw/master/"
file="hsb_ok.sav"

linkToFile=paste0(location,file)
```

The object **link** only has the location of the file, then we can read it like this:

```{r openFile, eval=FALSE}
library(foreign)

hsb=read.spss(linkToFile,to.data.frame = T)
```
The object **hsb** has tha data. Software like R can try to recognize the data types, but it may not always get it right:

```{r strHSB, eval=FALSE}
str(hsb)
```

We need to make sure we get it right!

From the previous result: Which remain as factor, as character, or as ordinal? (check [here](https://github.com/UWDataScience2020/data/blob/master/hsb_ok_metadata.pdf))

```{r changeType, eval=FALSE}
as.ordered(hsb$SES)
```
Data types are critical for selecting the right visual.

## ELEMENTS

### 1. **BASE**

You may want to create a **base** component, just to inform the data frame you are using and the variable(s) to plot:
```{r baseGGplot, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

base=ggplot(data=hsb, # data frame
            aes(x=MATH)) # what to plot
```

Notice that in **aes**thetics you tell what variable will be used to represent some information in the plot:

* Dimensions x, y, z .
* Color.
* Size.
* Label.

You may need to customize the **aes** in other elements.

### 2. **GEOMs**

Let's make a simple histogram:

```{r histodefault, eval=FALSE}
#
plot1= base + geom_histogram()
# I need this to see the result:
plot1
```

The GEOM selected depends on the data type.


### 3. **LABELS**

Label are important to guide the reader. You have main title, subtitle, source, and axis labels.

```{r labels, eval=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# all text for titles
Titles=list(Title="Nice title",
            SubTi="sub is here",
            XTi="Level of MATH",
            YTi="Amount of students",
            Sou="Source: imaginary")
#
# using the previous texts
plot2= plot1 + labs(title = Titles$Title,
                    subtitle = Titles$SubTi,
                    x=Titles$XTi,
                    y=Titles$YTi,
                    caption = Titles$Sou)
plot2
```

### 4. **ANNOTATION**

Here, you can write freely some text in a particular location of the plot:

```{r Annot, exercise=TRUE, eval=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

#texts for annotation
message="HELLO"
#
#annotating
plot3=plot2 + annotate(geom = 'text',
                       x =50,y=20, #position
                       label=message)
plot3
```

### 5. **BACKGROUND**

You can decide what background to choose:

```{r Background, exercise=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
plot4=plot3+ theme_classic()
plot4
```

## OBJECTS

Every visual is composed of a set of objects that will encode the information you are trying to share. In ggplot2 jargon, they are known as the **geoms**, as you have already seen. You can customize every geom.

Our previous histogram can have **aes**thetics:

### 1. **LEGEND**

If you use color, shape or other attribute in the aesthetics of the geom, you will also produce a legend.

```{r legend, eval=FALSE}
plot1legend=base + geom_histogram(aes(color=SEX))
plot1legend
```

You can improve the previous result with facets:

### 2. **FACETs**

Facets will use variables to divide the plotting area:

```{r facet1, eval=FALSE}
plot1legFacet1=plot1legend + facet_grid(~SEX)
plot1legFacet1
```

```{r facet2, eval=FALSE}
plot1legFacet2=plot1legend + facet_grid(SES~SEX)
plot1legFacet2
```

### 3.**DOTS**

Dots are theoretically an adimensional object (no width, no height), so they can serve you to represent location. 

These are the options available in R:

Let me select one dot option in the geom **point** by altering its _shape_:

```{r dots, eval=FALSE}
base=ggplot(data= hsb,
            aes(x=MATH,y=WRTG)) + theme_light()
plotDots=base + geom_point(shape=16)
plotDots
```

### **4. LINES**

Lines are unidimensional objects. They mainly represent distance, so they are a clear option for numerical values; if they were to be used for categorical values, make sure the audience will not interpret distance.

They can also serve:
– for representing direction (with or without arrow tips) and slope.

– for representing linear relationships.

– for representing angles (two lines needed).

These are the options:

Let me select one option when I request a geom (smooth) that will compute a linear trend to the previous plot:

```{r lines, eval=FALSE}
plotLine=plotDots + geom_smooth (method = lm,
                                 se=FALSE,
                                 colour =" red ",
                                 lty=5)
plotLine
```
